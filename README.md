 What is Monocalcium Phosphate?  
Monocalcium phosphate is an essential feed additive used primarily in the agricultural sector to ensure optimal animal health and productivity. Derived from high-grade phosphate rock, MCP is rich in both calcium and phosphorus, two critical nutrients for the growth, bone development, and overall well-being of livestock.  
Whether used in poultry, swine, or cattle diets, MCP supports stronger skeletal structures, enhances metabolism, and boosts reproductive performance. Its high bioavailability ensures efficient nutrient absorption, reducing feed waste and improving cost-effectiveness for farmers.
